# Background
Pipid frogs include 4 genera: Pipa, Hymenochirus, Pseudhymenochirus, and Xenopus, and Xenopus includes two subgenera: Xenopus and Silurana.  Ben Furman and a previous student (Adam Bewick) have done some interesting work on the evolution of sex chromosomes in subgenus Xenopus that illustrates variation among major clades in the identity of sex chromosomes (in other words, some species within this subgenus have sex chromosomes that are not homologous to those of other species).  A recent [paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/34/E4752) reports a complex set of sex chromosomes in the species Xenopus tropicalis, which is in subgenus Silurana.  We have also recently published a [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23666865) of the sex chromosomes of X. tropicalis and found that there exists a large pseudoautosomal region on these chromosomes. Further, a simulation study I did a few years indicates that sex chromosomes of amphibians regularly turnover.  Of interest, then, is the identification of sex chromosomes in multiple amphibian lineages and ultimately the identification of the genes that trigger sex determination in these lineages.  THis information promises to inform us about "developmental systems drift" of sex determination, that is the evolution of variation in the genetic mechanisms that underlie conserved phenotypes.

# Goals
The goal of this project is to identify the sex chromosomes of a pipid frog in the genus Hymenochirus and to test whether they are homologous to those of X. tropicalis, X. laevis, or X. borealis.


# Work involved
This will involve purchasing Hymenochirus frogs from local pet stores and raising a cross in the laboratory.  We have already tried this once but were unsuccessful because the adults all died in the lab.  We proposed to change the way we care for these animals by adding heaters to the water - this has proved successful with another species (X. new tetraplid 1) that we recently raised in the lab.  Animals from this cross will be raised until they are post-metamorphic (~6-12 months) and then sacrificed and sexed using surgery.  Genetic samples from these animals will be used for GBS and linkage to the sex phenotype assessed using established methods such as those implemented by the program Tassel.

# Anticipated impact
I anticipate that this will produce a medium to high impact publication on the identify of the sex chromosomes in Hymenochirus that woudl be suitable for journals such as Evolution or Genome Biology and Evolution.  Similar to the Ph.D. dissertation of Ben Furman, which is focused on the sex chromosomes of X. borealis, this project could be expanded to include exploration of the specific genes that determine sex through comparison to the complete genomes of X. tropicalis and X. laevis.  It could also lead to independent studies of sex biases in the rates of recombination between male and female individuals.  As such this project could form the core of Caroline's Ph.D. dissertation.

# Key collaborators
I anticipate that Ben Furman would play a key role in contributing to this project by helping with the animal husbandry and analysis of GBS data.

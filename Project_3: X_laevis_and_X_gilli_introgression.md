# Background
The African clawed frogs *Xenopus laevis and X. gilli hybridize in their contact zone in southwest Cape Province, South Africa.  X. gilli occurs only in a small region on the edge of this province and is listed as endangered by the IUCN.  X. laevis is common and occurs throughout the range of X. gilli and additionally occurs throughout other parts of South Africa and up into Malawi.  Previous studies of this hybrid zone have not recovered evidence of gene flow between these species but these studies are based on only a handful of genetic markers.

# Goals
The goal of this study is to test for evidence of introgression between *X. laevis* and *X. gilli*, and also between populations of X. gilli.

# Work Involved
Data collection for this project is almost complete.  A few more genes could be sequenced for several individuals but we have >10 loci sequenced for populations east and west of False Bay for *X. laevis* and *X. gilli* and for samples collected in 1994 and also more recently. The manjor work remaining is to fit the data to isolation-migration models implemented by the program MIMAR and we have done previously. This will expose Caroline to computing with the sharcnet computer cluster and introduce her to some simple BASH scripting and plotting with R. It will also expose her to a simple MCMC approach to parameter estimation.

# Anticipated Impact
I anticipate that this will produce a low impact publication suitable for a journal such as Conservation Genetics.  Results will offer insights into whether the extent of gene flow has changed over time (between 1994 and 2010), in a managed versus an unmanaged area (the west population is managed but the east population is not), and also within populations of *X. gilli*, which may constitute separate species.  A more comprehensive publication using RADseq is anticipated to follow that will involve a visiting student from South Africa (Lihko Sikutshwa) from John Measey's lab.  John already has funds in place for the RADseq and the costs for Lihko to visit McMaster.

# Key Collaborators
This is a collaborative project between the Evans lab (including Ben Furman and Graham Colby) and Measey labs.  I anticipate that an Evans lab student will be lead author on the Sanger sequencing portion of this work but that Likho would be lead author on the RADseq portion.

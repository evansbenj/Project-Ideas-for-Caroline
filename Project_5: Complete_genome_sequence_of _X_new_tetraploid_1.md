# Background
The tetraploid species "X. new tetraploid 1" will soon be officially named.  This species is closely related to X. tropicalis and is an allotetraploid, meaning it was formed via the fusion of two ancestral diploid genomes.  We have recently demonstrated that one of these genomes was an ancestor of X. tropicalis; the other was another diploid species that is possibly extinct or undiscovered.

# Goals
The goan of this project is to sequence and analyze the complete genome of "X. new tetraploid 1".  Several questions will be answered, including 
* whether recombination occurs between subgeomes
* whether there is phylogenetic bias between subgenomes in pseudogenization
* whether there is crosstalk between subgenomes in TEs

The significance of this work is to inform us about intracacies of allopolyploidization that were not previously possible. This will be of comparative interest to, for example, the genome sequences of the diploid species X. tropicalis and the tetraploid species X. laevis.

# Work to be done
Most of the sequencing is done already, including low coverage of single chromosome libraries, and multiple different insert sizes (180 bp, 600 bp, 1kb, 6kb, and 10kb).  We are waiting still for some increased coverage of the low insert size (3 Illumina lanes, hopefully done soon).  All of these data except the single chromosome libraries are from one female individual.  The single chromosome libraries are from several tadpoles of unknown sex.  We may be able to ascertain which libraries are from the same tadpole (this was done by collaborators in the Cxech Republic).

The first task to be done is the genome assembly. This probably will be done by Michael Schatz.  Once the genome assembly is in hand, we can begin the genome analyses.  The assembly will probably be split among thousands, or tens of thousands of scaffolds.  I anticipate that different collaborators could be responsible for different aspecies of the analysis.

# Anticipated impact
I anticipate that this will result in one or more medium to high impact papers in journals such as Molecular Biology and Evoution or Genome Biology.  At this time, I anticipate that I will be lead on this prokect and that other lab members will be co-authors.

# Key collaborators
This is a collaborative project that includes CHris Mason (Cornell Medical Center), Mike Schatz (Cold Spring Harbor), and Vladimir Krylov (Charles University, Prague).

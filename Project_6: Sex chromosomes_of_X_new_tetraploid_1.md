# Background
The yet to be named species "*X.* new tetraploid 1" is a tetraploid that is closely related to *X. tropicalis*.  We have performed GBS on a lab cross of this species with an aim of identifying the sex chromosomes and evaluating whether they are homologous to those of *X. tropicalis*.  We also hope to use these data to test whether there is variation in the rates of male and female recombination.  These questions are relevant to several theories to account for sex chromosome homomorphy including rapid turnover hypothesis and the ever-young hypothesis.

# Goals
To identify the sex chromosomes of "*X.* new tetraploid 1" and to test whether there is variation in the rates of male versus female recombination.

# Work involved
The lab cross and GBS sequencing is done. Preliminary analyses have been performed that suggest that the sex chromosomes of this species are homologous to those of *X. tropicalis*. Remaining work includes the quantification of rates of recombination in males and females and construction of a genetic map

# Anticipated Impact
I anticipate that this will be a medium impact study that would complement and possibly be included in the studies by Ben Furman of sex chromosome evolution in *X. borealis*.

# Key Collaborators
This is a collaborative effort in the Evans lab including Ben Furman.  Depending on the scope of Ben's papers in progress on *X. borealis*, this could be led by Ben or (if published independently) it could be led by Caroline or Ben.

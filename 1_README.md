# Project-Ideas-for-Caroline
This is a list of projects in the lab that hopefully will help Caroline Cauret to get started on her Ph.D.

In general, I think the best plan of action is for Caroline to proceed immediately with three projects:
* Phylogeography of *X. laevis* and *X. petersii*
* Gene flow between *X. laevis* and *X. gilli*
* Sex chromosome evolution in *Hymenochirus*

The rationale behind these three projects is that the first will introduce Caroline to fundamental methods in the lab including DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and Sanger sequencing. The second will introduce Caroline to the sharcnet computer cluster. The third, which potentially will form the core of her Ph.D. research, needs to begin as soon as possible because it is based on a laboratory cross and the animals will need a while (6-12 months) to mature through metamorphosis. Another advantage of the first two projects is that they will produce publishable data quickly, and this will strengthen Caroline's cv for fellowship applications. The other projects may complement these efforts or serve as a platform for collaboration.

# Background
Pipid frogs include 4 genera: Pipa, Hymenochirus, Pseudhymenochirus, and Xenopus, and Xenopus includes two subgenera: Xenopus and Silurana.  Ben Furman and a previous student (Adam Bewick) have done some interesting work on the evolution of sex chromosomes in subgenus Xenopus.  A recent paper in PNAS reports a complex set of sex chromosomes in the species Xenopus tropicalis, which is in subgenus Silurana (http://www.pnas.org/content/112/34/E4752).
